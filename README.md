## Learning Git and GitHub
Some useful resources:
1. Traversy Media crash course on Git: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfTXHrWMGVY
3. https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/33982  Discusses issue I was first having where I needed to enter my GitHub password even though I had already set SSH keys. This link then leads to: https://gist.github.com/bsara/5c4d90db3016814a3d2fe38d314f9c23 where it discusses the files one needs to create in their root user directory to enable use of SSH keys (i.e., bypass having to enter the GitHub password all the time). Here is the info from the latter link.
